# Textor

A safe, deterministic scaffolding and refactoring CLI tool for Astro + modern frontend projects.

Textor enforces strict separation of concerns:
- **Pages** = Thin routing adapters
- **Features** = Self-contained implementation modules
- **Components** = Reusable UI primitives

The tool is designed to be production-grade, principal-engineer approved, and optimized for large teams and long-lived codebases.

## 🔒 Core Principles

1.  **Explicit over implicit** — No magic behavior.
2.  **Safe by default** — Never delete or overwrite hand-written code.
3.  **Configurable over hardcoded** — Everything driven by configuration.
4.  **Reversible operations** — Add, move, and remove operations are always supported.
5.  **Deterministic output** — Same input always produces the same structure.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# In your Astro project
pnpm add -D @oamm/textor

# Initialize configuration
pnpm textor init
```

This creates .textor/config.json with default settings and initializes the state tracker.

## 🏗️ Scaffolding Presets

Control structural complexity using presets. Presets apply to both add-section and create-component.

-   **minimal**: Lean defaults, minimal folders. Ideal for simple components and features.
-   **standard**: Balanced structure. Includes hooks, tests, and types by default.
-   **senior**: Full enterprise-grade layout including API, services, schemas, and documentation.

Select a preset via the --preset flag:
```bash
pnpm textor add-section /users users/catalog --preset senior
```

## 🗺️ Routing Mode

Textor supports explicit routing strategies to avoid ambiguity in Astro projects.

-   **flat**: /users → src/pages/users.astro (Default)
-   **nested**: /users → src/pages/users/index.astro

Configure this in .textor/config.json:
```json
{
  "routing": {
    "mode": "nested",
    "indexFile": "index.astro"
  }
}
```

Textor supports multiple frameworks (React, Astro). By default, components are created as React components (`.tsx`), while features and pages are Astro components (`.astro`).

Configure this in `.textor/config.json`:
```json
{
  "components": {
    "framework": "react"
  },
  "features": {
    "framework": "astro"
  }
}
```

## 📦 Feature Entry Strategy

Avoid filename collisions for feature entry files.

-   **pascal**: src/features/users/catalog/UsersCatalog.astro (Default)
-   **index**: src/features/users/catalog/index.astro

Configure this in .textor/config.json:
```json
{
  "features": {
    "entry": "pascal"
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Safety & File Tracking

Textor uses a multi-layered safety approach to protect your codebase.

### 1. File Signatures
Every file generated by Textor includes a signature (e.g., <!-- @generated by Textor -->). Textor will refuse to delete or move any file missing this signature unless --force is used.

### 2. State Tracking & Hashing
Textor maintains a .textor/state.json file that tracks:
- File paths and kind (route, feature, component)
- Templates used
- **Content hashes**
- Creation timestamps

### 3. Integrity Verification
Safe deletion and moves require:
1.  Valid Textor signature in the file.
2.  Presence of the file in the state.
3.  **Hash match** (verifying the file hasn't been manually edited).

If you have manually edited a Textor-generated file and wish to remove or move it, use --accept-changes or --force.

## 🛠️ Commands

### add-section
Create a route + feature binding.

```bash
pnpm textor add-section <route> <featurePath> [options]
```

**Options:**
- --preset <name>: scaffolding preset (minimal, standard, senior)
- --layout <name>: Layout component name (use "none" for no layout)
- --name <name>: Custom name for easier state lookup
- --endpoint: Create an API endpoint (.ts) instead of an Astro page
- --dry-run: Preview changes without writing to disk

### create-component
Create reusable UI components.

```bash
pnpm textor create-component <ComponentName> [options]
```

**Options:**
- --preset <name>: scaffolding preset (minimal, standard, senior)
- --dry-run: Preview changes without writing to disk

### move-section
Move and rename sections safely. Textor performs **deep renaming**: if the feature name changes, all internal files and component signatures are updated automatically.

```bash
# Using state lookup
pnpm textor move-section /old /new
```

### remove-section / remove-component
Safely remove Textor-managed modules.

### list-sections
List all Textor-managed modules, including their architectural capabilities (API, Hooks, etc.).

### status
Show drift between state and disk. This is a read-only command used to build trust and identify manual changes or missing files.

```bash
pnpm textor status
```

**Categories:**
- **SYNCED**: File content matches state exactly.
- **MODIFIED**: File exists but content differs from state hash.
- **MISSING**: File is registered in state but missing on disk.
- **UNTRACKED**: File has a Textor signature but is not in state.
- **ORPHANED**: File is in a managed directory but has no Textor signature and is not in state.

### validate-state
Validate that the state file matches the project files.

### sync
Synchronize the state with the actual files in managed directories. This is useful for including existing files into Textor's state or updating hashes after manual edits.

```bash
pnpm textor sync [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--include-all`: Include all files in managed directories, even without the Textor signature.
- `--force`: Update hashes for modified files even if they don't have the Textor signature.
- `--dry-run`: Preview what would be synchronized without making changes.

### adopt
Adopt untracked files into Textor's state and add the Textor signature to them. This is the recommended way to bring manually created components or sections under Textor's management.

```bash
pnpm textor adopt <path-or-identifier> [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--all`: Scan all managed directories for untracked files and adopt them.
- `--dry-run`: Preview which files would be adopted and modified.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Adopt a specific component directory
pnpm textor adopt src/components/MyNewButton

# Adopt a section by its route
pnpm textor adopt /users

# Adopt all untracked files in the project
pnpm textor adopt --all
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

Textor is designed with enterprise-grade robustness, moving beyond simple scaffolding to provide a reliable refactoring engine.

### 1. Atomic State Operations
State updates to `.textor/state.json` are atomic. Textor writes to a temporary file (`state.json.tmp`) and performs a cross-platform rename to the final destination. This prevents state corruption during crashes or interrupted operations.

### 2. Robust Hashing & Normalization
Textor uses SHA-256 for file integrity. It supports multiple normalization strategies:
- **normalizeEOL** (Default): Converts `\r\n` to `\n` before hashing. Ensures Git "autocrlf" settings don't trigger false alerts.
- **stripGeneratedRegions**: Hashes only the content within `@generated by Textor:begin` and `@generated by Textor:end` markers. This allows developers to add hand-written code outside these regions without breaking Textor's integrity checks.
- **none**: Strict hashing of the entire file.

### 3. Explicit Ownership Model
Every file in the state has an **owner**. 
- A **Section** owns its route adapter and its associated feature directory.
- A **Component** owns its specific component directory.
Textor enforces ownership boundaries to prevent accidental deletion of shared resources and to ensure deep refactors only touch relevant files. Use `--force` to override ownership checks.

### 4. Kind Inference & Rules
Textor can infer the "kind" of a file (e.g., `route`, `feature`, `component-file`) during synchronization. You can define custom rules in `.textor/config.json`:
```json
{
  "kindRules": [
    { "match": "src/features/custom/**", "kind": "custom-logic" },
    { "match": "**/special.ts", "kind": "special-file" }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Git Safety Integration
Textor integrates with Git to provide a "safety net":
- `requireCleanRepo`: When enabled, Textor refuses to perform destructive operations (remove/move) if the repository has uncommitted changes.
- `stageChanges`: When enabled, Textor automatically stages (`git add`) all created or modified files after a successful command.

### 6. Scoped & Repo-wide Import Rewriting
When moving or renaming sections, Textor performs scoped AST-like updates:
- **Scope**: Updates imports in Textor-managed files and route adapters by default.
- **Repo-wide**: Use the `--scan` flag to scan the entire repository for imports that need to be updated.
- **Exclusions**: String literals, markdown documentation (unless registered), and complex dynamic imports are preserved to avoid breaking hand-written logic.
